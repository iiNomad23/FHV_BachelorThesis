### Abstract
The development of technical systems is a complex and costly process. It is therefore
important that the products are tested specifically and carefully before delivery to the
customer. Due to scarce resources and deadline pressure, this is often neglected, or
only carried out inadequately.

A test case management system makes it possible for features to be tested and approved
before a product is released. This in turn enables newly implemented features to be
thoroughly tested, thus contributing to the high quality of the product. As a result,
stable hardware as well as efficient and well-structured software can be delivered to
the customer.

The goal of this thesis is to develop a Test Case Management System, which makes
it possible to describe features of measurement systems of the company Gantner
Instruments. In addition, the test case management system should be able to receive
test results from an already existing test automation system and assign them to
features.

The Test Case Management System developed in this thesis allows a precise description
of features and test results as well as their storage in a database. Using a standardized
API, data can be retrieved from the system and processed by external systems. By
carefully documenting features and test results, statistics and reports can be generated
that reflect which features were successfully tested. This makes it possible to monitor
the progress of testing and to determine, based on target goals, which features are ready
for release and can be incorporated into the product.
